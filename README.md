I'm Ali, an experienced Digital Marketer, entering the world Cyber Security.

I am currently studying Cyber Security with Hyperion and CoGrammar, learning about Python, Cyber Crimes and Ciphers. I am looking forward to learning more.

## About Me 👩‍🦱  

As a Digital Marketer, I have worked with a lot of data owned by small businesses, so understand the importance of keeping it safe, a resource which may not be available to small businesses, and in some cases they don't even know why it is important. I am looking forward to working with small businesses on their cyber security to help them keep their data safe and secure and build even more trust in their brand.
